              <h2 id="1-introduction-to-cybersecurity">1. Introduction to CyberSecurity</h2>
              <p>Information Security: it is the protection of the information and how it is modify.
                Information System Security: protecting the systems that access the information.</p>
              <h3 id="11-cia-triad">1.1 CIA Triad</h3>
              <p>These are the core values we should always have:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: ensure that info has not been disclose to unauthorized people;
                  these include keys and passwords that allows to protect the information.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: ensuring that the information has not been modified without
                  authorization; if we could go to a bank website and modify our balance that would be an availability
                  failure; we can use hashes for this purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability</strong>: being able to access the information when needed.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="12-aaa-of-security">1.2 AAA of Security</h3>
              <p>There are 3 main values:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: when a person&#39;s identity is establish with proof; we have 5
                  methods:<ul>
                    <li>Something you know.</li>
                    <li>Something you are.</li>
                    <li>Something you have.</li>
                    <li>Something you do.</li>
                    <li>Somewhere you are.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: when an user is given access to access a certain part of a place.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accounting</strong>: these trackers data and computer resources; for this we use logs, this
                  allows us to know who and what they did. Non-repudiation is when the user can not say &quot;I did not
                  do it&quot;, because I have the proof you did so.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="13-security-threat">1.3 Security Threat</h3>
              <p>The 4 main categories are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Malware: malicious software such as adware, randomsware, virus, etc.</li>
                <li>Unauthorize access: gain access to computer resources or data without the consent by breaching the
                  security.</li>
                <li>System Failure: when a computer crashes.</li>
                <li>Social Engineering: manipulating users to reveal confidential information, it usually happens by
                  phishing emails.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="14-mitigating-threats">1.4 Mitigating Threats</h3>
              <p>There are controls that can help us:
                Physical controls: alarms, security cameras, batches id.
                Technical controls: smart cards, intrusion detection, etc.
                Administrative controls: policies, security awarennes, contingency planning; these can be divided by
                those that are mandatory by law because of the nature of the company, and on the other hand those that
                are implemented by the company; these can also be call managerial controls. It is important to use all
                of these.</p>
              <h3 id="15-hackers">1.5 Hackers</h3>
              <p>Types of hackers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>White Hat: somebody non malicious, who tries to access the systems with authorization in order to
                  test the security.</li>
                <li>Black Hat: someone malicious who breaks in computers os systems without permission.</li>
                <li>Gray Hat: it is a hacker who breaks without authorization but they do not want to steal the data nor
                  do something malicious; they are in the middle.</li>
                <li>Blue Hat: tries to break a systems but have not been hired, for example bug bounty hunters.</li>
                <li>Elite: those who find and exploits vulnerabilities before anyone does, they program their own tools,
                  exploits and attacks. They are very very good and can be malicious or no malicious, it is estimate
                  that only 1 of 10000 hackers are elite hackers. These are the best of the best.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="16-threat-actors">1.6 Threat Actors</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Script Kiddies: baby hackers that only uses automatic tools, they do not have skills and do not even
                  know what the tools do. This is how many of us start.</li>
                <li>Hacktivists: hackers who are drive by social causes, for example anonymous. They are those who only
                  uses any tool available trying to find anything they can, they do not know how the tool works; these
                  the babies of hackers.</li>
                <li>Organize crime: organization who are very well funded, they usually do it for the money, for example
                  the ransomware groups.</li>
                <li>Advance Persist Threats: highly trained hackers, usually from governments, for example China or
                  Russia. They are very good and when gain access they usually do little to no noise and are difficult
                  to detect.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="17-threat-intelligence">1.7 Threat Intelligence</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Time: the information it is important with the relavancy of time, as things change.</li>
                <li>Relevance: that the intelligence matches the case intented and what affects me.</li>
                <li>Accuracy: makes that the informaiton produces effective results, it is important that the
                  information is not false positives.</li>
                <li>Confidence leves: ensures qualified statements about the reliability of an information, are the
                  things relavant and reliable.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="18-threat-hunting">1.8 Threat Hunting</h3>
              <p>It is a technique to detect the present of threats that have not been identify, the idea is to be
                proactive instead of being reactive (most of what the SOC does). We establish a hypothesis and start our
                path, asking who may want to attacks us, and then using the intelligence we can have an idea who may be
                doing the attacks. We analyze logs and others from monitoring tools; when we are threat hunting, we need
                to assume that the existing rules have failed and therefore things that have bypass the rules, assuming
                that the adversary is smart and avoiding detection. Threat hunting consumes a lot of resources and time
                in order to detect something. With the threat hunting results we can then:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Improve detection capabilities.</li>
                <li>Integrate intelligence.</li>
                <li>Reduce attack surface.</li>
                <li>Block attack vectors.</li>
                <li>Identify critical assets so we know what attackers are after to.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="19-attack-framework">1.9 Attack Framework</h3>
              <p>The kill chain is:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Reconnaissance: the attackers need to find out what methods they need to attack us; after this we
                  need to have an idea of this network is build.</li>
                <li>Weaponization: the attacker creates payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.</li>
                <li>Delivery: the attacker uses a method to get the payload to the system, using whatever method they
                  can such as email.</li>
                <li>Exploitation: is when the malicious code is executed in the system.</li>
                <li>Installation: it is a mechanism that enables weaponized code to run a remote system.</li>
                <li>Command and Control (C2): where we set a channel to a remote server where we can have control of the
                  other system.</li>
                <li>Actions of Objectives: where the attacker now does what they wanted to do from the beginning, all
                  the previous steps where only to gain access and do this.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This is the linear typical process, however there are another frameworks, for example the Mittre
                Framework, this is not linear but instead circular. Another one is the pre-ATT&amp;CK which is form
                preventing an attack.</p>

              <h2 id="2-malware">2. Malware</h2>
              <p>Malware is a software desing to infiltrate a system without their knowledge or consent, there are
                varios types.</p>
              <h3 id="21-virus">2.1 Virus</h3>
              <p>It is malicious code run in the machine without the user&#39;s knowledge, the key part of a virus is
                that we as users take an action that allow the code to execute. There are 10 types of viruses:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Boot sector</strong>: it is stored in the first sector of the hard drive and it is run
                  everytime that we load the computer, this is very difficult to detect since it loads before the
                  operative system. </li>
                <li><strong>Macro</strong>: is a virus hidden in a virus, and when we open a file this are executed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Program viruses</strong>: it is an executable that seeks to hides inside a program so that
                  everytime we load a program we load the virus too.</li>
                <li>Multipartite: it combines a boot sector virus with a program virus; it wants to load as boot and
                  then everytime it can install itself in any program and reinstall everytime.</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypted viruses</strong>: the viruses trying to be better they encrypt its contents to it
                  be very difficult to detect them.</li>
                <li><strong>Polymorphic virus</strong>: an advance encrypted virus that changes its decryption module in
                  order to avoid detection even more.</li>
                <li><strong>Metamorphic</strong>: a virus that rewrites itself before infecting a file.</li>
                <li><strong>Armored virus</strong>: they have a layer of protection that allows them to protect themself
                  to avoid being analyze.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoax virus</strong>: it is a program that we are trying to make the user install, we do not
                  have a virus unless we follow the instructions that are given.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="22-worms">2.2 Worms</h3>
              <p>It is very similar to a virus but it differs that it does not requires the user&#39;s action in order
                to execute, they can self replicate and spread without the user&#39;s action, for example take advantage
                of unpatch systems, they can disrupt network traffic by the replication they use; they distribute very
                fast.</p>
              <h3 id="23-trojans">2.3 Trojans</h3>
              <p>It is malicious software that it is disguised as something legit, it can even do what the user wanted
                but it will also execute something malicious, one subtype is Remote Access Trojan (RAT) it allows the
                attacker to have remote control of your machine and do whatever we want.</p>
              <h3 id="24-ransomware">2.4 RansomWare</h3>
              <p>It is a malware that restricts the information in the systems, the encrypter ask for a payment in order
                to decrypt the files, the best approach is not to pay the ransom and also have updates backups; uses
                some vulnerabilities to encrypt the information.</p>
              <h3 id="25-spyware">2.5 Spyware</h3>
              <p>It is a software that gathers information about us without our consent, it goes through all the
                applications getting as much information of us as possible, it also could install keylogger or also take
                screenshot of access the webcam; a subtype of this is adware which wants to display ads to us according
                to want they discover we are interested in. The last one is grayware which is a software used to make
                something to the victim but not necessarily malicious but annoying (like jokes).</p>
              <h3 id="26-rootkits">2.6 Rootkits</h3>
              <p>A software desing to gain admin controls to a system without being detected; with admin (root)
                priviliges they have access to the Ring 1 and the closer to Ring 0 or having access to the Ring 0 the
                best. They uses dll injection which is a malicious code inserted into a running process from a Windows
                machine by taking advantage of the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) which are loaded in runtime. It can also
                be done with driver manipulation because drivers have access to the kernel. This happens because of a
                shim is placed between it intercept the system calls. These are super powerfull and difficult to detect.

                however it could be dangerous if it contains malware inside the message. They use open mail relays which
                is use an organization to send messages from a company sender domain. There is also spim which is spam

              <h3 id="31-common-delivery-methods">3.1 Common Delivery Methods</h3>
              <p>The most common are software, messages and media. Another method is watering hole which is our routine
                habits which we do everyday so could be websites which we need to use and could have malware. Even
                though if we have somethings we need to do and use, attackers could be use somethings very similar so we
                fall in the fake website for example, and place malware in that website.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>This happens when a computer is placed between the sender and the receiver (men in the middle), the
                attacker can get credentials and even modify incoming traffic to embedded some malware in it. Now
                privilege escalation is when we use bugs to get access to resources that a normal user shouldn&#39;t
                have access to; this is order to get closer to the kernel.</p>
              <h3 id="34-backdoors-and-logic-bombs">3.4 Backdoors and Logic Bombs</h3>
              <p>Backdoors are use to bypass security authentication protocols, this was used originally to make updates
                to the systems, it used to be something common but they should not be use anymore; however a RAT (Remote
                Access Trojan) could be seen as a backdoor because we are bypassing the security protocols; another
                things are easter egg which is a joke, for example to he do a roll from Google, however this is a
                security concern because it does not go through security revisions.
                From here we get the logic bomb, in which the programmer or attacker puts some code that it is only
                executed when certain conditions are meet, for example delete all the database when I am not in the
                payroll; all these things should be avoided.</p>
              <h3 id="35-symptoms-of-infection">3.5 Symptoms of Infection</h3>
              <p>We can note that the computer behaves strange, the most common is that starts to run slower or
                displaying ads, another symptom is that the computer start crashing more frequently; also if the hard
                drive or file are not accessible anymore, basically when the computer starts to behaves strange. Also
                appearing or disappearing icons; all these is done to get persistent, also by getting double extension
                on files; or for example creating new files or folder, or changing the structure of the files; the final
                system is that we can not go to System Restore in Windows because the malware is trying to maintain the
                persistence, this can solved by loading the secure boot or boating externally and then removing the
                virus.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Scan the computer.</li>
                <li>Make sure we have a backup of all files since we can lose it all.</li>
                <li>What symptoms has the computer, because from this we can know what type of malware has the computer.
                </li>
                <li>Quarantine the system, to avoid it from communicating with other systems and infect them; we can
                  make turning off the network card.</li>
                <li>Disable the System Restore (Windows) because we do not want the system to keep taking snapchats from
                  the systems as we could restore some shot that is infected.</li>
                <li>Remediate the infected system; basically use some antivirus running the computer from a secure boot
                  to avoid detection by the virus.</li>
                <li>Schedule automatic updates and scans, this is the preventing measure to prevent the malware to come
                  back; make at least one scan per week.</li>
                <li>Enable System Restore and create a new restore point.</li>
                <li>Finally we will provide user with security awareness training so this doesn&#39;t happens in the
                  future.</li>
                <li>If we suspect of a boot sector virus we need to reboot the computer from an external device. We
                  could also disconnect the external drive and load it and scale it from another secure endpoint.</li>

              <h3 id="37-preventing-malware">3.7 Preventing Malware</h3>
              <p>Viruses can be prevented by using a good antivirus, it is important to also updated the operative
                system constantly, we need to path the security breaches discovered. To detect:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses</strong>: we should use antivirus and keep our system updated as well as keeping
                  firewalls and using encrypted websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms, trojans, and ransomware</strong>: can be better detected by antivirus, ransomware can
                  be detected in delivery by seeing suspicious programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware</strong>: there are special systems making sure no spyware and being deploy in our
                  system, as well as having low level trust in the internet. We can detect it if we see a lot of ads of
                  different browser homepage.</li>
                <li><strong>Rootkits</strong>: scanners can be detect a rootkit before installing it, if it is already
                  install it is very difficult to delete, we can try to detect it by running a scan from a external
                  secure boot.</li>
                <li><strong>Spam</strong>: we should verify our server to avoid that user use our servers, also removing
                  email addresses from public places to avoid being subscribe to websites mail lists.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In summary we should always:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Update our antivirus use in our computer, and check the computer weekly.</li>
                <li>Always keep our systems up to date.</li>
                <li>Educate our users of good internet security practices.</li>

              <h3 id="38-malware-exploitation">3.8 Malware Exploitation</h3>
              <p>An exploit technique is a method in which a malware infects a system, modern malware uses fileless
                techniques in order to avoid detection by signature-based malware. Here is how it works:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Dropper or downloader</strong>: is by running light shell-code in our system which will
                  download the rest of the malware, the idea is to trick the user to click or do something.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain access</strong>: the malware needs to download something like a RAT to persist
                  access.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen access</strong>: the malware tries to find more systems in the network, and get
                  the permissions they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions on objectives</strong>: now the attacker has the permission he need and will do what
                  he wanted from the beginning.</li>
                <li><strong>Concealment</strong>: the attacker will keep their access but they will also try to delete
                  every evidence that they were ever in the system.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Now let examine every part individually:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Dropper</strong>: its only purpose is to retrieve the rest of the malware from the internet;
                  shell-code will refer to any code to get any type of external exploit; they can obfuscate or encrypt
                  the payloads.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Injection</strong>: it is a exploit technique that runs malicious code with the id from
                  a legitimate process id; can be made by masquerading, DLL Injection, DLL Side-loading, or by Process
                  Hollowing.</li>
                <li><strong>Living Off the Land</strong>: exploit technique that uses system tools and packages to
                  perform intrusions; the idea is to use your own tools agains you to make more difficult the detection
                  and keep much longer inside the system.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="4-security-applications-and-devices">4. Security Applications and Devices</h2>
              <p>The devices and applications that allows us to keep our systems secure, specially laptops.</p>
              <h3 id="41-software-firewalls">4.1 Software Firewalls</h3>
              <p>They sit at the edge of our network and protect what comes in and out, however personal firewalls are
                host-based and should control what is coming in and out of our system. As they are software based we
                need to consider the OS:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Windows: <strong>Windows Firewall</strong>, can be the normal our an advance firewall with more
                  configuration.</li>
                <li>MacOS: the <strong>PF and IPFW</strong>, which is a built-in firewall. There is also a command
                  option: pf.</li>
                <li>Linux: <strong><code>iptables</code></strong>, which is a command line tool; also many anti-malware
                  systems also offer firewalls and they need to be up to date since all software is vulnerable.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some companies however like to have network-base firewalls and dedicated servers for firewalls for
                avoid using computer resources however we could use both firewalls to have two protection layers.</p>
              <h3 id="42-ids--intrusion-detection-system">4.2 IDS - Intrusion Detection System</h3>
              <p>It is a software of device in a network that detects intrusions, there are two:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>HIDS (Host-based detection system): it is usually a software that logs everything that seems
                  suspicious.</li>
                <li>NIDS (Network-based detection system): it is something that receives all the info from the devices.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Either of these two will search for signature-based intruders (bytes that may trigger an alert), also
                could be a policy-based detection, another one is anomaly-based where the systems knows patterns from
                our network and triggers anything suspicious.</p>
              <p>The IDS only alert but do not stop, the IPS can stop the malicious activity. The HIDS are the logs used
                to recreate the actions taken by the attacker. There are types of alerts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>True positives.</li>
                <li>True negatives.</li>
                <li>False positives.</li>
                <li>False negatives.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="43-pop-up-blockers">4.3 Pop-up Blockers</h3>
              <p>Most of the time these are use for malicious things however sometimes they can be for something legit,
                the problem with this is that attackers can embedded link to malicious websites. We could use
                ad-blockers but some websites do not allow the website if we have. Another solution could be content
                filters; but the best defense again these is to make sure the browser is up to date and disable them
                when is possible.</p>
              <h3 id="44-data-loss-prevention-dlp">4.4 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</h3>
              <p>It is uses to monitor the data from a company, and its transit to avoid losing it or being steal. These
                systems can be software or hardware:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Endpoint DLP System: they are software based in the client and if they detect that someone is trying
                  to transfer data they can stop it.</li>
                <li>Network DLP System: software or hardware based that monitor the data leaving the place and block
                  data that should not go out.</li>
                <li>Storage DLP System: they inspect data at rest for anomalous activity.</li>
                <li>Cloud DLP System: cloud system that protects our systems in the cloud, usually offer by the cloud
                  provider.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>They all review all the movement of our data making sure none leaves without authorization. </p>

              <p>BIOS is the type of firmware (chip&#39;s software to control how to send input and output); most of
                computers they use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) they are almost the same. The BIOS tells
                how to read the hard-drive, loads the machine and how to use the rest of the components; to secure it we
                need:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Flash the BIOS: making sure that the BIOS has the most updated version of the BIOS.</li>
                <li>Use a BIOS password: this will prevent anyone from changing the way that the computer loads, this
                  should be a strong password.</li>
                <li>Configure the Boot Order: this so it can only be loaded from our main hard-drive for example.</li>
                <li>Disable the external ports that we do not use, for example we do not use serial ports anymore.</li>
                <li>Enable the secure boot option: this makes that the BIOS goes through additional steps when loaded
                  and makes sure we load only secure versions.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="46-securing-storage-devices">4.6 Securing Storage Devices</h3>
              <p>We should always encrypt our files, in Windows we could use bit-locker or removable media controls that
                are technicals limitations implemented to limit the access to files (for example write and read
                privileges), we can also use a network attach storage (NAS) these systems uses RAID arrays to ensure
                availability to the networks, another one is Storage Area Network (SAN) which is a system implemented to
                perform block storage functions. Some tips:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Always use data encryption.</li>
                <li>Use proper authentication.</li>
                <li>Log NAS access to the devices, so in case anything goes wrong we can go back and find the
                  responsible.</li>

              <h3 id="47-disk-encryption">4.7 Disk Encryption</h3>
              <p>It scrambles the data into unreadable information so no one can read it. Two type of encryption:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Self-Encrypted Drive (SED): these are hardware-based drives that has embedded hardware that provides
                  encryption.</li>
                <li>Software Encryption: for Mac we have FileVault, for Windows we have BitLocker. They both use the
                  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that keeps the key in the motherboard that makes the disk unreadable to
                  anyone else even if removed if we do not have the key; they both use Advance Encryption Standard (AES)
                  that may be 128 or 256 bits symmetric; they are good but makes our systems slower. In Windows we use
                  IFF that is only encrypt some files.</li>
                <li>Hardware Security Module (HSM: uses for hardware encryption, that can be plugged for encryption but
                  they are expensive.</li>

              <p>An endpoint is any device used to connect to our network; we can list the next endpoint methods and
                devices used to protect our endpoint:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Anti-virus: software capable of detecting malware and other types of attacks.</li>
                <li>Host-based IDS/IPS: monitors a computer for unexpected behavior, or changes in the file system.</li>
                <li>Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP): software agent and monitor system that performs multiple
                  security task, DLP, Firewall and file encryption among other; it is more based in signature analysis;
                  one example is SentinelOne.</li>
                <li>Endpoint Protection and Response (EDR): similar to the EPP however it relies more in behavior, it is
                  to provide monitor the system and respond faster to a threat.</li>
                <li>User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA): this is more of analyzing the data collected for
                  suspicious activity so they are very depend on AI because they have to make a lot of analysis in a lot
                  of data; some examples of these are Microsoft and Splunk User Behavior Analytics.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Many companies have started to combine multiple of these and selling them as a single combo.</p>

                <li><strong>WiFi</strong>: we should use the higher levels, today WPA2 that uses AES.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: they share a link key to link their data, however some devices uses
                  weaker security.</li>

              <h3 id="52-mobile-malware">5.2 Mobile Malware</h3>
              <p>The first thing should be to have an anti-virus application in our phone, whether Android or iPhone, as
                well as making sure that the device is always up to date with software updates. If in Android we found a
                vulnerability Google has to path it and send it to the manufacturer and then he send it but this takes
                time, we should always install applications from the official store but the apps can also get to the
                store sometimes. We should also have the defenses up, so we need to be careful of where and what we
                browse. Some scams also come via SMS with link where if we click them we go to a malicious website. So
                we should:</p>

                <li>Do NOT jailbreak it.</li>
                <li>Do NOT use custom firmware or a custom ROM.</li>
                <li>Only load official apps from the official store.</li>
                <li>Always update the device&#39;s operating system.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="53-sim-cloning-and-id-theft">5.3 SIM Cloning and ID Theft</h3>
              <p>SIM stands for Subscriber identify Module, which is a circuit that store the International Mobile
                Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and its related key, if someone can clone this number they can pretend to be
                us. SIM Cloning allows attackers to get access to our personal&#39;s data as we both get a copy of the
                data, however this is no longer easy since they are much much harder.</p>
              <p>Attackers find another way in which they call the carrier and they transfer the SIM to another phone,
                this is very important because attackers wants this for 2-Step Authentication; this is ID Theft. To
                protect again this we should be careful where we put our phone number, another way avoid this is to get
                a Google Voice Number to use and nobody know our real number.</p>
              <h3 id="54-bluetooth-attacks">5.4 Bluetooth Attacks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Bluejacking</strong>: it is sending unsoliciting messages to Bluetooth enable devices, here
                  we send info.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluesnarfing</strong>: it is unauthorized access to the information of a device via
                  bluetooth, here we take.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In most cases most of the devices uses the default pairing key (0000), another way is that we could
                turn off bluetooth of make it no-visible.</p>
              <h3 id="55-mobile-device-theft">5.5 Mobile Device Theft</h3>
              <p>We sure do a full disk encryption on our devices, as well as setting up tracking services to locate the
                phone, we should also have remote lock which is lock the phone when we know it&#39;s been lost, as well
                as remote wipe to delete all data from the lost device.
                Security of Apps
                We should only install applications from the official store, we should not jailbreak/rooting it. When
                ever we browse a website we should always use the SSL version of the website to use Transport Layer
                Security (TLS). Mobile Device Management are uses to create and enforce policies in the mobile devices
                (for an organization). We should be careful about the location access services. Geotagging is embedding
                the geolocation into a piece of data, for example into a photo as metadata, we need to be careful this
                because someone could get information about this.</p>
              <h3 id="56-bring-your-own-device-byod">5.6 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</h3>
              <p>If we allow users to bring their device to our organization this could have a lot of security issues
                for our organizations since we do not control anything related to the user&#39;s devices; however some
                companies like it since they do not have to buy computers or endpoint to the employees. Companies uses
                Storage Segmentation, that it is use to draw the line between data and work information. The employees
                will not let the company to install Mobile Device Management (MDM) in the phones; so we have a solution:
                Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) this gives the employee the choice of a couple of phones and then the
                company can install what the company needs, in this way both parts win. The MDM allow for example to
                disable the phone from connecting to public WiFi networks since they are not secure; the company has to
                take the decision of what they will use but not use the default.</p>

              <p>The 10 best way to increase the security of a device:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Keep the device updated to the latest software update.</li>
                <li>Install anti-virus.</li>
                <li>Train user in good security practices and what to use and not to use. </li>
                <li>Only install apps from the official stores.</li>
                <li>Do not root or jailbreak the device.</li>
                <li>Only use v2 SIM cards with the devices.</li>
                <li>Turn off all unnecessary wireless features.</li>
                <li>Turn on encryption for voice and data.</li>
                <li>Use strong password or biometrics for login.</li>
                <li>Don&#39;t allow BYOD in companies; rather CYOD.</li>
              </ol>
              <h2 id="6-hardening">6. Hardening</h2>
              <p>This is the act of configuring an operative system by removing unneeded apps and implementing policies
                to make it safe, the idea is to implement secure measures to avoid attackers; we are not guarranting
                than nothing bad will ever happen but making it more secure, minimizing the risk.</p>
              <h3 id="61-unnecessary-applications">6.1 Unnecessary Applications</h3>
              <p>We should have Least Functionality that means we should only allow and have install only what the user
                really needs and uninstall all left. In large networks preventing unneeded applications is the best. For
                Windows we can use the System Center Configuration Management (SCCM).</p>
              <h3 id="62-restricting-applications">6.2 Restricting Applications</h3>
              <p>We need to restrict what application can be run in which endpoint. This can be done by Application
                Allowlisting that means only what we allow to run special programs, on other hand is the Application
                Blocklisting where all apps will be allow to run except the ones in the list. Using allowlist is more
                secure but more difficult to control, but the blocklist has the problem that any variation of a program
                will run; they can both be centrally managed.</p>
              <h3 id="63-trusted-operating-system">6.3 Trusted Operating System</h3>
              <p>Exist a certification for operation systems that meats some government requires, from Windows 7, MacOS
                X 10.6, FreeBSD and RedHat are consider trusted operating systems; they must patch continuously the
                systems.</p>
              <h3 id="64-updates-and-patches">6.4 Updates and Patches</h3>
              <p>A patch is a single problem-fixing piece of software, it is similar to Hotfix but this one does not
                require a reboot of the system where patches do; there are 5 categories of updates:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Security Updates: software code to solve a vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Critical Update: software code that addresses for a critical problem but not related to security.
                </li>
                <li>Service Pack: it is a tested, cumulative grouping of patches and some minor changes; these are only
                  released over the years.</li>
                <li>Windows Update: recommended updates that changes some visual changes for example.</li>
                <li>Driver Update: solves security issues from drivers or add new features for the drivers.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="65-patch-management">6.5 Patch Management</h3>
              <p>This is the planning, testing, implementing and auditing of software updates, his makes sure that a
                patch does not creates a new issue; for this we use Patches Management Systems and the process:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Planning: procedures to determine if a patch needs to be deploy.</li>
                <li>Testing: we need to test it before deploying, we should have a lab or machine use to test and make
                  sure that they work properly, after testing we can deploy.</li>
                <li>Implementing: if the test was successful we can deploy the update; we can control centrally manage
                  updates instead of the Windows automatically, we can disable this last one.</li>
                <li>Auditing: after deploying we use this to make sure everything has gone well.
                  Group Policies
                  Also know as GPO (Group Policy Object); it is a set of rules or policies apply to user, to access we
                  go to: cmd&lt;gpedit. Each policy has a template for example for password requirements and etc. We can
                  set a baseline to what is normal, for what we could consider normal network traffic, some breaches
                  have been discover by unusual network activity.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="66-file-systems-and-hard-drives">6.6 File Systems and Hard Drives</h3>
              <p>The file system affects the way a system is secure; Windows system ca n be NTFS (New Technology File
                System) and Fat32; we can convert it from one to another one. In Linux can be ext4 and for MacOS is
                APFS. Hard drives will eventually fail but we can do:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Remove temporary file by using Disk Clean Utilities.</li>
                <li>Do Periodic File System Checks.</li>
                <li>Defragment your drive every time to time.</li>
                <li>Back up our data.</li>
                <li>Use and practice restoration techniques; this include test the back ups.</li>
              </ol>
              <h2 id="7-supply-chain-assessment">7. Supply Chain Assessment</h2>
              <p>We can verify the components of a device we use in our networks, this allows to know what the
                components may have been expose to; we have to secure hardware, software, firmware, OS, and
                applications; however the importance of this depends on the company. Due Diligence is a legal principle
                that manifest that a products is in an optimal condition; for example if I buy something from a company
                do I know they will be in 5 years to give support to the product, will they be there to help us
                something goes wrong; this principle should be apply to suppliers, contractors and etc. A Trusted
                Foundry Program is a microprocessor manufacturing utility that is part of a validated supply chain, this
                has been created by the department of defense (DoD); we just need to know that the chips are secure. The
                Hardware Source Authenticity the source from where we get something affects its security, if possible we
                should go directly to the manufacture.</p>
              <h3 id="71-root-of-trust">7.1 Root of Trust</h3>
              <p>A Hardware Root of Trust (ROT) this is a cryptographic module embedded used to scan the boot metrics
                and OS files to validate and sign files so that we can trusted; the objective is the Trusted Platform
                Module (TPM); we just need to remember that this TPM is the one that allow us so that every-time we load
                the system it loads securely. Another is a Hardware Security Module (HSM) that is a generating and
                storing cryptographic keys, it is software-based. The Anti-Tamper are methods that makes difficult for
                attackers to mess with these protective measures, we have the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and a
                Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) that prevents attackers from modifying these things.</p>
              <h3 id="72-trusted-firmware">7.2 Trusted Firmware</h3>
              <p>A firmware exploit gives the attacker the highest level of privilege; we need to understand the
                following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>UEFI</strong> (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface): offers support for 64-bit CPU
                  operations at boot.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Boot</strong>: prevents unwanted processes from loading.</li>
                <li><strong>Measured Boot</strong>: gather metrics to validate the boot process in an attestation
                  report.</li>
                <li><strong>Attestations</strong>: a claim that the data presented is digitally valid and signed using a
                  TMP&#39;s private key.</li>
                <li><strong>eFUSE</strong>: a means for software or firmware that persistently alters a transistor of a
                  chip. Here uses a one time programming that makes sure that the code can not be rewritten.</li>
                <li><strong>Trusted Firmware Update</strong>: firmware updated that is digitally sign so we know it is
                  secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Encrypted Drives</strong>: it does the encryption and decryption automatically by the
                  firmware and a hardware level.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="73-secure-processing">7.3 Secure Processing</h3>
              <p>It is a mechanism to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a software code. We
                have:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Processor Security Extensions</strong>: Low-level CPU that enable secure processing, they
                  are divided by:<ul>
                    <li>AMD:<ul>
                        <li>Secure Memory Encryption (SME).</li>
                        <li>Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Intel:<ul>
                        <li>Trusted Execution Technology (TXT).</li>
                        <li>Software Guard Extensions (SGX).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trusted Execution</strong>: The CPU&#39;s security extensions invokes a TMP and Secure Boot
                  to ensure that a trusted security system is the one running.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Enclave</strong>: extension that allows a trusted process to create an encrypted
                  container for sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Atomic Execution</strong>: they are some operations that can only be run once or not at all,
                  this can be safe against buffer-overflow attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Bus Encryption</strong>: data that is encrypted by an applications prior to being places on
                  the data bus; this will make sure that the data send via network or the bus, is trusted, this will
                  work only if on the other side the data is also trusted.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="8-virtualization">8. Virtualization</h2>
              <p>A system virtual machine is an idea to create an entire platform, mean while a processor virtual

              <p>Manages the distribution of the physical resources to the virtual machine, there are two:
                Type I: also know as bare metal, runs directly on the host and works as an operation system itself; they
                tend to be more efficient.
                Type II: runs over an operation system.
                Container-based: the OS kernel is shared for all but the user space is unique, this allows to run
                distributed applications and makes these more efficient; for example Docker.</p>
              <h3 id="82-threats-to-vm">8.2 Threats to VM</h3>
              <p>VM are separated from other VM:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>VM Escape: happens when an attacker breaks from the isolated part and get to the space of another
                  virtual machine.</li>
                <li>Data Remnants: happens when we deescalate a server and the files that were in it are not deleted and
                  an attacker gets it.</li>
                <li>Privilege Escalation: happens when an user gets access to the permissions from the kernel.</li>
                <li>Live Migrations: happens when we migrate a VM and an attacker gets in between of the transfer and
                  therefore happens a Man-In-The-Middle.</li>
                <li>When the attacker get to exploit the main OS that host all the VMs and therefore they all are at
                  risk.</li>

              <h3 id="83-securing-vms">8.3 Securing VMs</h3>
              <p>The hypervisor need to always be updated; we should always limit the connectivity between the virtual

                using proper patch management and also virtualization sprawl to keep track of all the machines created,
                the user and permissions assigned, also not having shared folder so that the machines are isolated, and
                finally encrypting our virtual machines.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Implement good policies for administrative control. </li>
                <li>Train the users. </li>

              <ul>
                <li>Cookies are sued to store client information, habits and credentials; there are tracking cookies
                  uses by spyware to get what we use and do, session cookies are to keep track of users and preferences,
                  as well as for tracking the users. People do not like this so they use service tracking services so
                  that we can block cookies. If we want to protect them we need to to use the Secure Attribute on the
                  Cookie because SSL/TLS do not protect the cookies&#39;s confidentiality.</li>
                <li>Locally Shared Object (LSO) they are store in the Windows system in AppData folder, they should no
                  longer be used.</li>
                <li>Add-Ons that are small extensions and plugins, we need to be sure about what code we install and
                  what code don&#39;t install.</li>
                <li>Advanced Security Options, here we can change to only use SSL/TLS when browsing.</li>

              <h3 id="93-securing-applications">9.3 Securing Applications</h3>
              <p>We should use passwords to protect files from viewing or even being modifying; we should check our
                MACROS setting and disable them always. Also we can use digital certificates to only show information to
                those with authorization. The User Account Control (UAC) allows us to get an user in a controlled access
                to prevent unauthorized access, so the user runs like a normal user instead or an admin user.</p>

                <li>Maintenance: we do bug fixes, patches and so, and education the users on how to use it. We need to
                  have in mind version control and configuration management, usually with numbers (1.1).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The problem with this is that it is slow, so an alternative to be able to add features during
                development is using Agile methodology, and working with sprints. DevOps are the people who work as
                software developers and IT as well so he can be that bridge and get the app live faster.</p>
              <h3 id="101-sdlc-principles">10.1 SDLC Principles</h3>
              <p>Developers should always remember confidentiality, integrity and availability. To best protect are our
                applications we should make sure to use secure coding practices instead of implementing many security
                extra layers. When we program we should keep in mind:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Least privilege: for example that our program does not need admin rights.</li>
                <li>Defense in Depth: making it secure in all layers.</li>
                <li>Never Trust User Input: always make sure to validate the user input.</li>
                <li>Minimize Attack Surface.</li>
                <li>Create Secure Defaults: making our default configuration the most secure one.</li>
                <li>Authenticity and Integrity: using code signing to verify our code has not been change during the
                  download process.</li>
                <li>Fail Securely: use error handling for exceptions instead or crashing.</li>
                <li>Fix Security Issues: if we discover a vulnerability then patch ASAP.</li>
                <li>Rely only on Trusted SDKs: they all must come from trusted sources to ensure no malicious code has
                  been added.</li>
              </ul>

                <li><strong>System Testing</strong>:<ul>
                    <li><strong>Black-box</strong> Testing: the tester is not given any information related to the
                      system and it is my responsibility to discover everything.</li>
                    <li><strong>White-box</strong> Testing: the tester is given all the details of the program, like
                      source code and diagrams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gray-box</strong> Testing: the tester is given some information about the program but
                      conducts the test like if he has no info, for example if he has the list of users but makes the
                      test as normal.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Structure Exception Handling (SEH): provides a control over what the app should do when a runtime
                  error occurs. From these we can discover if the programmers did input validation, and this can be an
                  entry point for an attacker.</li>
                <li>Static Analysis: is when we analyze the source code by reading it manually or with automatic tools
                  and we try to find some errors.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Analysis: is the testing during the run of the program, common is Fuzzing where we inject
                  random data attempting to find vulnerabilities in the system by input.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Backdoors: it is software code that it is there by developers in order to bypass authentication
                  methods, backdoors should never be used by programmers; however some attacker may created.</li>
                <li>Directory Traversal: method of accessing unauthorized directories by moving through the directory
                  structure.</li>
                <li>Arbitrary Code Execution (ARC): when an attacker is able to run commands on a victim computer but
                  here the person has to be present in the physical space.</li>
                <li>Remote Code Execution (RCE): similar to ARC but here the attacker can runs the commands remotely.
                </li>
                <li>Zero Day: when someone discover a totally unknown vulnerability to the system.</li>

              <p>Occurs when a process stores data outside the memory of the program; 85% of the breaches were caused by
                an overflow attack. The problem with this is that we are messing with the stack and the memory of other
                programs, being able to even replace the code that the program is supposed to run. They try to rewrite
                the return address of the code so it goes somewhere else, this is call the Smash the Stack, so the
                program runs until finds our malicious code.
                One of the mitigating is Address Space Layout Randomization so the return addresses are randomized so
                the attacker can not know where to overflow the stack.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): when the attacker embeds malicious script code the a trusted website,
                  there are 3 types; to prevent it we should always use input validation and disabling scripting things:
                  â—¦ Stores/persistent: attempt to get data provided by the attacker to be saved in the website.
                  â—¦ Reflected.
                  â—¦ DOM-Bases: attempt to exploit the victimâ€™s web browser.</li>
                <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF): when an attacker forces an user to execute actions on a web
                  server that they are already authenticated, to make look requests as if they came from us. To prevent
                  these we should use encryption, tokens, XML File scanning and checking cookies twice to verify the
                  integrity of these ones.</li>

                most commons injections are: SQL, HTML, XML and LDAP injections. We can prevent it by using input
                validation and least privilege principle when accessing the database, and do NOT trust input.</p>
              <h3 id="107-xml-vulnerabilities">10.7 XML Vulnerabilities</h3>
              <p>This is a markup language, we should always use encryption and input validation, to prevent it we must

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>XML Bomb (Billion Laughs Attacks): encodes entities that expands the size and consuming resource of
                  the memory on a host to make it crash potentially.</li>
                <li>XML External Entity (XXE): embeds a request for a local resource.</li>

              <p>Something from parallel programming when it fails by the race conditions by accessing a variable at the
                same time by threats; the vulnerability is when we remove the relationships from the pointer to point it
                to something malicious. They can be used agains files and databases not only OS. The Time of Check/Time
                of Usage is when it is a change between when the app checked the resource and when the app used the
                resource, so if the attacker figured out the time when the app checked the resource and when the app
                used it; for example if we buy something in Amazon that it is no longer in stock.
                To prevent it we can:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Not running things in a sequence.</li>
                <li>Implement locking mechanism to exclusive access.</li>

                  with this we can know who, what, when, where and how something happened.</li>
                <li>Weak of Default Configurations: this happens a lot in the real life, and also that people run things
                  with root permissions or they use the defaults configurations that are weak. We should use secure

                <li>Data Link: how connections are established and maintained, like MAC Addresses.</li>
                <li>Network: routing and switching information, the frame for layers 2 become packets; use routers.</li>
                <li>Transport: TCP or UDP for transmitting packages; they are segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP).</li>
                <li>Session: manages the establishment, synchronization and termination of the session.</li>

              <p>They operate at level 2, they are the combination of hubs and bridges, each port of a switch act as
                both of them. They are vulnerable to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>MAC Flooding: overwhelm the limited memory that the system has for MAC Address in the port.</li>
                <li>MAC Spoofing: the attacker mask their own MAC Address to pretend to be another device when for
                  example the MAC Address is blocked; this can be combine with other protocols using MAC.</li>
                <li>Physical Tampering: when the attacker gets access to the switch because they can be reconfigure on

              <p>Most of the network are usually map in LAN, WAN and DMZ; we should route our traffic through a VPN when
                accessing the internet. The De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) is to control the access to servers that have
                public access. Not all devices require the same level of protection, some may need more or less and for
                this we can use sub-zones and extranet which is a special DMZ but it is not publicly accessible.
                Intranet is a special internet for our only company.</p>
              <h3 id="114-jumpbox">11.4 Jumpbox</h3>
              <p>Internet-facing host or devices are the devices that accept traffic from all the internet, even if they
                did not request it. The DMZ is isolated from the rest of our network, this can accept request from the
                internet but it is separated from the rest of the internet and if someone scans our network they will
                not see everything in our network; anything that someone from the internet may need should be in our
                DMZ.
                A jumpbox is a server that can communicate with the DMZ from the internal network, it is like our bridge
                but this requires heavy security configurations and programs; they can even be VM. A jumpbox is also
                good idea for systems where we do not have much control.</p>
              <h3 id="115-network-access-control">11.5 Network Access Control</h3>
              <p>NAC is used to protect the network from know and unknown devices, it scans the devices connected and
                then checks anything that could make our network unsafe, if the device fails it is placed in quarantine
                and then receive any update that it may need, they can have persistent and non-persistent networks, this
                last one is more for networks where people use their own devices, for example connecting to a public
                internet place. One of the standards used is the IEEE 802.1x.</p>

                  and use SSH instead, and keep our number secrets.</li>
                <li>Public Branch Exchange (PBX): the internal phone system used in our organization, attackers use this
                  to make long distance calls for free, for this we should remove any remote access points.</li>
                <li>Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP): we should not place this VOIP in the same subnet as our
                  computers, this phones are connect by their own IP phone and this connects to the gateway to make the
                  connection work; this devices should always be updated and have good encryption.</li>
                <li>Quality of Service (QoS): the availability is required since VOIP required a lot of bandwidth and

                technologies to protect the network; it is just see all the devices as one device, so the administrators
                can use a graphic interface instead of a command line. The Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) is a
                all-in-one device to protect the network.</p>
              <h2 id="13-cloud-security">13. Cloud Security</h2>
              <p>Cloud computing relies heavily in virtualization. Hyperconvergence allows providers to fully integrate
                the storage, network and server, they also offer Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) which allows to
                handle much better things with virtual machines for even endusers. We have secure enclaves and secure
                volumes.</p>
              <h3 id="131-cloud-types">13.1 Cloud Types</h3>
              <p>Four types of cloud:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Public</strong>: a service provider makes resources available to the users in the internet.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Private</strong>: a company creates its own cloud environment that only uses internal
                  resources, when security is more important than cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: strict rules should be applied.</li>
                <li><strong>Community</strong>: the cost and resources are shared among organizations, this involves
                  many security challenges since every network may involve their own risk.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="132-cloud-as-a-service">13.2 Cloud As A Service</h3>
              <p><strong>Four types</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Software As A Service (SAAS)</strong>: we are provided a complete solution; software,
                  hardware and anything required, so the users can access the tool from the browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)</strong>: we have access to all the resources and we
                  configure them as we want, but we do not worry for long-term tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform As A Service (PAAS)</strong>: the provider will give us the specific hardware and
                  service.</li>
                <li><strong>Security As A Service (SAAS)</strong>: when a company outsources the security
                  responsibilities to another company. This can even reduce cost since we don&#39;t need the security
                  24/7; however we lose control over our data. We can also have sandboxing in which we can test any
                  possible malware, and see the effects of this malware.

              <p>We need to consider that we may have our resources in a space where another company has their content
                and they may not have the same level of security. We should always make sure that the resources have the
                latest software updates. We should use strong password and similar things; and the data should always be
                encrypted.</p>
              <h3 id="141-defending-servers">14.1 Defending Servers</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>File Servers: any computer may access this server in the world, we should make sure that it has
                  logging tools and strong encryption.</li>
                <li>Email Servers: at the minimum we have 3 open ports but are usually more; we should have spam
                  filtering and quarantine policies as well as strong policies configuration.</li>
                <li>Web Servers: they must be in the DMZ and have firewall and patch.</li>
                <li>FTP Server: stores files to distribute among the web, for example to distribute an app, they must
                  have a secure connection to transfer any files.</li>
                <li>Domain Controller: aka Active Directory in Windows; this is usually a target for hackers, one common
                  attack is the Golden Ticket, they have strong configuration, with the latest software and in a secure
                  environment in the network.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="142-cloud-based-infrastructure">14.2 Cloud-Based Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>We need some knowledge to configure the cloud as strong as our local network; we can consider Virtual
                Private Cloud (VPC), it is consider a private network with a single cloud consumer within a public
                cloud; as a consumer it is responsibility to configure the IP Address. With On-premises solutions we
                have the benefit of having physical access, but if it fails it is our total responsibility; which cloud
                we do not need to worry about fails but we don&#39;t have physical access to it. The cloud has the
                benefit of many many resources to use in AI and Machine Learning. We also should be careful of vendor
                lock for in the future we want to move to another provider. </p>
              <h3 id="143-casb">14.3 CASB</h3>
              <p>Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) it is a management software designed to mediate access to cloud
                services by across all the users; this makes sure that our device is connected to the correct device. So
                we have: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Single sign-on.</li>
                <li>Malware and rogue device detection.</li>
                <li>Monitor/audit user activity.</li>
                <li>Mitigate data exfiltration.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We need to consider Forward-Proxy but this is vulnerable to Proxy-Bypass, so we can also consider
                Reverse Proxy but this only works if the application support Reverse Proxy. We can also use API to
                indicate which users allow access and deny to. APIs allow integration between many services. We can use
                curl to test APIs.</p>
              <h3 id="144-function-as-a-service-and-serverless">14.4 Function As A Service and Serverless</h3>
              <p>FAAS is a service that allows to run things without having our own server. We can just write some code
                and run it in this enviroment. Everything here is a function or microservice and so it should only do
                one thing; for example Netflix. This eliminates the need to managed the server and all its requirements;
                we can even set it to only be run and charged for us the only time that we need/use.</p>
              <p>We do not need to patch the server, no file system monitoring and is cheaper. Our job here is only to
                ensure that the clients accessing the service have not been compromised, that our code is secure, that
                the credential are safe. One of the problems is that we trust the service provider that they will surely
                do the job correctly, we won&#39;t have control over what they do. It is all about automation/fast.</p>
              <h3 id="145-cloud-threats">14.5 Cloud Threats</h3>
              <p>Most of the threats are from user&#39;s identity. Here is a list:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>API</strong>: we should always:<ul>
                    <li>Use it over a secure (HTTPS) channels.</li>
                    <li>Server-Side Validation.</li>
                    <li>Error-Messages: what clues are we given the user, without giving too much details.</li>
                    <li>Prevent DDOS.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improper Key Management</strong>: we need to:<ul>
                    <li>Make sure of being use secure authentication and authorization.</li>
                    <li>DO NOT hardcode or embed keys into the source code.</li>
                    <li>Generates new keys when going to prod.</li>
                    <li>Delete unneeded code.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</strong>:<ul>
                    <li>The logs must be copy to a long-term retention place, to prevent losing them.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unprotected Storage</strong>: they usually are call buckets (AWS) or blobs (Azure):<ul>
                    <li>Access control should be very strict, and avoid misconfiguration and permissions.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect Origin Settings: use the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy, that tell the
                      domain to trust things from some specific domains; avoid XSS here.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

              <h3 id="151-workflow-orchestration">15.1 Workflow Orchestration</h3>
              <p>It is the automation of multiple steps; what do I need to get from A to B. Orchestration is the
                automation of the automations. There a three types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Orchestration</strong>: to things like cloud, like new VM.</li>
                <li><strong>Workload Orchestration</strong>: managing apps and things that work together.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Orchestration</strong>: working on the services itself.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="152-continuous-integration-ci--continuous-deployment-cd">15.2 Continuous Integration (CI) /
                Continuous Deployment (CD)</h3>
              <p>This tries to speed ups the process of software development to avoid all the steps that slows down. So
                in a shared environment everyone develop, test and deploys the code. With this we can test and commit
                multiple updates peer day. Continuous Delivery is always testing everything new, not necessarily install
                it at once but yes have it ready. Delivery is testing to get it ready and Deployment is to automate
                testing in order to get it ready production.</p>
              <h3 id="153-devsecops">15.3 DevSecOps</h3>
              <p>This makes the same as DevOps but also uses the part of the security measures required; this solves a
                lot of problems. So we put security and put it right at the beginning of the development process instead
                of the last as usually happens; we also test during and after the development; and we also automate
                compliance checks (speed up using scripts and similar).</p>
              <h3 id="154-infrastructure-as-code-iac">15.4 Infrastructure As Code (IAC)</h3>
              <p>This allows us to use script approaches to speed us process, has three areas:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Templates.</li>
                <li>Scripts.</li>
                <li>Policies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All these makes our organization safer. Some people want to have their own Snowflake Systems which are
                users who wants to make the things their way, even though their techniques may be slower. Also a proper
                IaC should always have the same output, and because of this we want to delete these snowflake systems;
                eliminate the Snowflake Systems, so we all have the same security.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence: are machines that simulate to think by themself.</li>
                <li>Machine Learning: a set of AI where we develop strategies for solving task by given a labeled
                  dataset so the machine can learn. The problem is that if we do not train it correctly then we could
                  train it to make wrong things like for example being racist, so they are as good as the dataset given;
                  usually the most typical examples of ML <ul>
                    <li>Neural Network: they try to adjust the system to become better every time.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Deep Learning: almost the same as ML but without further instructions, the model will take more

                    <li>Fraggle Attack: directs the traffic to the port 7 (UDP), this is an old vulnerability.</li>
                    <li>SYN Flood: the attacker initiates many HTTPS request but never establishes the handshake, so the
                      server reserver resources for this client but the client never arrived; flood guards can be
                      installed, or we can set timeouts to dismiss these unused connections.</li>
                    <li>XMAS Attack: a special package send to cause the device to crash because they don&#39;t know how
                      to handle it.</li>

                <li><strong>Ping of Death</strong>: sends an oversize and malformed package so the computer crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Teardrop Attack</strong>: breaks the packages so they can not be rebuild in the other side
                  and so the system crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent Denial of Service</strong>: exploits a security flaw to permanently break a
                  networking device by reflashing the firmware.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Session Theft: attacker guess the session ID and then take the already enabled session.</li>
                <li>TCP/IP: takes the TCP session between the computer if they can guess the next package number.</li>
                <li>Blind Hijacking.</li>

                  the browser.</li>
                <li>On-Path: is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications
                  between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other.</li>
                <li>ARP Poisoning: also known as ARP Spoofing, is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area
                  Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN to change the

              <p>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) this is something that can affect the physical systems because of
                all the signals that have been sent, to protect this we should use shield on the cables, for example
                using STP. Other one is Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) this is cause by radio waves. Other one is
                crosstalk happens when se have two cables on top of each other. Data Emanation is when inside our cables
                generates signals trying to escape and if someone captures it, then someone can try to capture it. All
                these problems can be prevented by using Protected Distribution Systems (PDS), which is a lock to every

                the network. The Rogue Access Point is an unauthorized Wireless Router that may be very weak and easy to
                break so should not be used and implement filters in the network. Another one is the Evil Twin, is a
                rogue replicating the same SSID to make users think they are connecting to the real network when they
                are not, this one can not be stop but preventing by making users use a VPN. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): the first protocol with 24-bit encryption.</li>
                <li>WiFi Protected Access (WPA): replaces WEP, uses RC4 for encryption, and ensure data integrity.</li>
                <li>WPA2: now uses a 128-bit encryption and solves some fails from the original one; CCMP and AES.</li>
                <li>WiFi Protected Setup: relays on an 8 digits code but break in two, should be disable.</li>
                <li>VPN: we should always use VPN, never trust any network.</li>

                victims of Jamming (when the radio frequency is getting interference). More advance is Access Point
                Isolation that segments every client connected and prevent from connecting to others.</p>

                more done digitally where the hackers shared their finds. IV Attacks is when an attacker observes the
                different keys shared and finds a mathematical relationship between them. WiFi Disassociation Attack, it
                targets a client and then captures the handshake that the client send when tries to connect again. Brute

              <p>It is the WiFi Protected Access 3, designed to solve the fails of WPA2, we should be using it; this has
                192-bits encryption when enterprise mode, in this mode is for business case that uses AES-256 and also a
                hash for integrity checking. In personal mode it uses CCMP-128 as the minimum encryption required. The
                big change is the removal of the Pre-Shared Key (PSX) exchange, now this is not possible to capture, we
                uses a Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), uses Perfect Forward Secrecy to protect the dat in
                long-term, so even if someone captures it, the persona can not use it:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The AP and the client use a public key to generate a pair of keys.</li>
                <li>The AP and the client exchange a one-time use session key using a secure algorithm to encrypt the
                  tunnel, for example using Diffie-Hellman.</li>
                <li>The AP sends the client messages and encrypts them using the session key created in step 2.</li>
                <li>The client will decrypt the message using the key from step 2.</li>
                <li>The process is repeated over and over. The keys changes a lot so if someone captures them, it does
                  not matter since they will change very soon in the same session.</li>

                RFID and is very used for authentication for doors or cars for example; it can operate from
                10cm-200meters, and it is vulnerable to malicious captures; so Near Field Communication (NFC) was
                invented, they can also be capture and reuse but they need to be 4cm close. All these technologies are
                vulnerable to capture and jamming so when should encrypt the transmission.</p>

                communicate with each-other; a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is something that allows the users to
                control these things; a Data Historian is a system that allow us to collect data of what has happen.
                Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is the control system that manages large-scale systems,
                the difference is that ICS manages one organization or building, but SCADA can manage multiple of them,
                this is like a central server. Modbus gives control server and SCADA hosts the ability to query and

                and the user makes a hash operations and send the results and the server checks if it is correct; if it
                is then it logged.</p>
              <h3 id="206-vpn">20.6 VPN</h3>
              <p>Builds a tunnel in an unsecured network, they are usually Client-to-Site VPN but they can also be
                Remote Access VPN and connect two offices. VPNs are very important, they keep our connection secure and
                encryption; they use two protocols different. A server is needed to make the VPN work, or we can have a
                VPN Concentrator. We should prevent split tunneling (accessing different the intranet and the internet)
                since this could be very unsecured.</p>

              <p>RADIUS provides dial-up, VPN and wireless authentication, it is a client side and runs on the 7 layer
                of OSI; this is the AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting); they run on port 1645-1646;
                TACACS is this but implemented by CISCO, runs on port 49 but it is cross-platform.</p>
              <h3 id="208-authentication-attacks">20.8 Authentication Attacks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Spoofing: the goal is assuming the identity of someone else, usually tried by Man-in-the-Middle.
                </li>
                <li>Man-in-the-Browser: intercepts the API calls from browsers.</li>
                <li>Passwords Attacks: one of these is password spraying.</li>
                <li>Credential Stuffing: can be prevented by not reusing password.</li>
                <li>Broken Authentication: a software vulnerability where the attacker gets access, for example making
                  very weak password requirements; or even like credential exposure or session hijacking.</li>

              <h3 id="211-models">21.1 Models</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: every file is consider an object, and the owner
                  decides who can access that object. Every object must have an owner, each owner determines the access
                  rights and permissions for each object, which means they have a lot of control.</li>
                <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: the computer decides who has access to what
                  objects, they do it by data labels for all subjects and objects. High, medium and low trust; so the
                  computer decides who can access something; compares the labels and if we have the minimum or above we
                  have access; but they also have the need-to-know; this can be implemented by Rule-Based or
                  Lattice-Based. This can be used in complex systems since this is very expensive to maintain.<ul>
                    <li>Rule-Bassed: compares the subject labels to meet rules.</li>
                    <li>Lattice-Based: uses complex maths operations to know who can access.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Roles-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: works by roles, and according to those roles the
                  people can access some data; we set permissions based on the user&#39;s job. Power Users is a special
                  user which has a little more permissions; we can do a lot of things with this.</li>
                <li><strong>Attribute-Bassed Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: uses conditionals to determine if we can
                  access something or not for example if I am from CyberOps I can access some tools; this is very
                  dynamic.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="212-best-practices">21.2 Best Practices</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Implicit Deny: all access to resources should be denied until I need to give access to someone,
                  unfortunately the systems are built otherwise.</li>
                <li>Least Privilege: users should only have the lowest level of access needed to perform their job.</li>
                <li>Separation of Duties: for example some task we need two of more things to sign off for it to prevent
                  data loss or similar.</li>
                <li>Job Rotation: this allows us to detect some suspicious made, like fraud.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="213-users-and-groups">21.3 Users and Groups</h3>
              <p>We can have multiple users and groups, these makes groups deeper and deeper. We can limits almost
                anything we want using Active Directory and we should always trust no one when configuring. Permissions
                can usually be read, write and execute but in Windows there are a few more. In Linux we set this by
                using <code>chdmod</code> this is Read(4), Write(2), Execute (1); if we have multiple of these we sum,
                and from here we assign by Owner, Groups, AllUsers; like 777 means that everyone has all permissions.
                Privilege Creep is when by accident we have additional permissions through different roles, this should
                not happen; to solve this we use User Access Recertification, so every user&#39;s permissions are
                checked time to time, like for example every year; any hiring, firing or promotion should trigger this
                review.</p>
              <h3 id="214-permissions">21.4 Permissions</h3>
              <p>Inherited happens automatically when a new group is created under a new group, so this new has all the
                permissions from the parent. From the parent to a child is called propagation; sometimes we want this to
                happen and sometimes we don&#39;t; we can disable inheritance from the properties. Groups should be
                assigned by roles and users always to roles, never set them individually; when we copy something it
                inheritance it to from the new folder; but if we move it it keeps the permissions set.</p>
              <h3 id="215-usernames-and-passwords">21.5 Usernames and Passwords</h3>
              <p> We need to always use strong passwords because the usernames can usually be easily guess; we should:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Always required the user to change the password.</li>
                <li>The user needs to change the password every 90 days.</li>
                <li>Always change the defaults admin or root password, and disable that account.</li>
                <li>Disable the Guest account (Windows).</li>
                <li>Enable CTRL+ALT+DEL to log in, this prevents malwares from running automated.</li>
                <li>Use good, strong policies in regards to the passwords.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="216-user-account-control">21.6 User Account Control</h3>
              <p>This UAC is a security component from Windows that allows us to always run as an standard user and only
                use admin privileges when strictly needed; this reduce the risk of malware; we can disable this but it
                is not recommended. </p>
              <h2 id="22-risk-assessments">22. Risk Assessments</h2>
              <p>It is the probability that a threat will be realized, our job is to minimize vulnerabilities; we can
                not control threats but we can minimize them however. Risk is the interception between threats and a
                vulnerability. If we have identified possible threats then we can work on some possible solutions to
                minimize a negative outcome if something bad happens; with risk we can:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Avoid it.</li>
                <li>Transfer it: for example if we have the risk of a hurricane we can buy an insurance.</li>
                <li>Mitigate it.</li>
                <li>Accept it.</li>
                <li>Residual: the risk remaining after trying all before, it is almost impossible that this does not
                  exist; every organization have their own risk acceptance rate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To make this we have to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Identify our assets.</li>
                <li>Identify our vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Identify the threats.</li>
                <li>Identify the impact if one of them is materialized.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="221-qualitative-risk">22.1 Qualitative Risk</h3>
              <p>Uses intuition, experience and others to evaluate risk; for example us evaluating a course, in order to
                do this the people evaluating must have experience and knowledge. We do not need to do a complex
                algorithm to evaluate it.

              <h3 id="222-quantitative-risk">22.2 Quantitative Risk</h3>
              <p>Uses numerical and monetary values to estimate the risk; we also estimate the magnitude of the impact
                resulting in a financial number, this allow organization to estimate the importance of this; it uses
                the:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): cost associated with the realization of each individualized threat.
                </li>
                <li>Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO): how many times a year can happen.</li>
                <li>Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We use the ALE to take actions and create policies in the company. It is really important because
                otherwise we could spend much more money than needed. There is also a hybrid approach, IT directors are
                usually people with a lot of experience in order to use both models correctly.</p>
              <p>The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the amount that would be lost in a single occurrence (AV) times the
                risk factor (RF). The annual loss expectancy (ALE) is the total cost of a risk to an organization on an
                annual basis. This is determined by multiplying the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence (ARO).</p>
              <h3 id="223-methodologies">22.3 Methodologies</h3>
              <p>Security assessments are all type of test that allow us to test every security part of the
                organization; for example we can do an analysis from the inside but also from the outside of the
                organization. These type of assessments can also be required by some contracts and some type of
                organizations; these type can be active or passive.</p>
              <h3 id="224-security-controls">22.4 Security Controls</h3>
              <p>There are three types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Physical controls.</li>
                <li>Technical controls: password, encryptions and etc.</li>
                <li>Administrative controls: changing the behavior of people instead of making something else, for
                  example telling the people they must lock the computer every time they leave the computer, or such as
                  mandatory vacations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>NIST also has other three:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Managements controls.</li>
                <li>Operational controls: things done by people.</li>
                <li>Technical controls: logical controls put in a systems to help secure it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Another one is:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Preventative: controls for before something happen, for example a backup battery.</li>
                <li>Detective: used to find out whether something happened or not, for example CCTV.</li>
                <li>Corrective: for after something occurs, for example recovering data fast.</li>
                <li>Deterrent: may not physically or logically prevent access, but it serves to discourage an attacker
                  from attempting an intrusion.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A single control can be categorized in multiple different categories, there is also a compensating
                control, which is something unusual, like an alternative that has a similar level of security.</p>
              <h3 id="225-types-of-risk">22.5 Types of Risk</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>External Risk: it is produced by non-human source, for example wild fires or natural disasters.</li>
                <li>Internal Risk: there are usual easy to see and therefore we may prevent them, for example that a
                  server will die eventually.</li>
                <li>Legacy Systems: anything old or computer that is still in use, for example something using Windows
                  XP.</li>
                <li>Multiparty: multiple systems or organizations connected and each of them brings their own
                  inheritance risk.</li>
                <li>Intellectual Property Theft: someone may wants to still our information, like stealing a patent.
                </li>
                <li>Software Compliance and Licensing: for example if I still an external software, I am bringing the
                  risk of that software to the organization.</li>

              <h2 id="23-vulnerability-management">23. Vulnerability Management</h2>
              <p>Seeks to identify any issues in a network, applications, database or any system prior to something bad
                happening. Once identified we may deploy countermeasures to prevent them; the process is scan, patch,
                scan and so on. We need to think of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Value: What is the value of what we could found; how important and private is something.</li>
                <li>Threats: what vulnerabilities is my system vulnerable to.</li>
                <li>Mitigations: what can we deploy to solve the vulnerabilities we found.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are important since they allow us to focus where we need to solve things, these programs are
                conducted using some type of software for scanning or some type of pen-testing; these programs will
                categorize them and give them to us to take action; steps to conduct them are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Decide the desired state of security.</li>
                <li>Create a baseline, understand what is normal.</li>
                <li>Prioritize the vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Mitigate vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Monitor the network and systems, as well as performing future tests; this process will repeat.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="231-penetration-testing">23.1 Penetration Testing</h3>
              <p>Breaks into the systems just like a hacker, in a blackbox test however some organizations can hire
                pentesters as blackbox test. After the test we get a report of what they found; usual tools are
                Metasploit or CANVAS, this is something that has to be done time to time. They follow the steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Get permissions &amp; document info.</li>
                <li>Reconnaissance.</li>

              <h3 id="233-vulnerability-assessments">23.3 Vulnerability Assessments</h3>
              <p><strong>Tools used to conduct these</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Mapping</strong>: discover and document of physical and logical connections in our
                  network; Solarwind, Zenmap are graphical tools that can map our network.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: identifies threats but they do not exploit them, some may
                  just find open ports and other more advanced can go deeper.</li>
                <li><strong>Banner Grabbing</strong>: get info from the system and inventor their systems; some tools
                  are Nessus or Qualysguard.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Sniffing</strong>: analyzing the traffic or capturing the packets going in the
                  network of anyone.</li>
                <li>Protocol Analyzer: taking these packets and reconstruct them almost identical, like Wireshark.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Password Analysis</strong>
                It is a tool used to test the strength of our password, they are also crackers; the most common are Cain
                &amp; Abel, and John the Ripper. We can do several attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Password guessing</strong>: we just got lucky trying to guess someone&#39;s password having
                  some key info. </li>
                <li><strong>Dictionary Attacks</strong>: having a list of possible passwords, some hackers may have
                  their own personalized dictionaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Brute-Force Attack</strong>: trying every possible combination, amazingly slows but sure,
                  complex strong password are a must nowadays.</li>
                <li><strong>Cryptanalysis Attack</strong>: computing a precomputed encrypted password to a value in a
                  lookup table this is call a rainbow table, and just compare the encrypted value and then check their
                  unencrypted value. Crackstation is one of the best rainbow tables.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubber Hose Attack</strong>: someone forcing other to tell their password, using violence.

              <p>Monitoring is trying to find whatever is not good, either by signature-based (detecting predefined
                patterns), or anomaly-based (establish what is normal and then set to analyze everything else), or
                behavior-based (an activity analyzed based on previous set things but this sets a lot of false
                positives); however we can use multiple of these (a hybrid approach).</p>
              <h3 id="241-performance-baselining">24.1 Performance Baselining</h3>
              <p>It is the process of measuring changes in a network, hardware and software; this helps us define what
                is normal. A security posture is the risk level to which a system is exposed. We can monitor operations
                and functionality, how much something is used, so we can detect something anomalous; we can make reports
                to compare it, in Windows we can use Perfmon.exe.</p>

              <h3 id="244-auditing">24.4 Auditing</h3>
              <p>It is a detective control, we look to see if everything is under control, we can review logs, ALC, user
                rights and permissions, vulnerability scans and else; logs are usually very important for this since
                they tell us what is right and what is not.</p>
              <h3 id="245-logging">24.5 Logging</h3>
              <p>Data files containing accounting and audit trails, they tell us what has been done in the endpoint; in
                Windows there are security, system and applications logs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Security Logs: successful and unsuccessful logins to the systems.</li>
                <li>System Logs: such as driver failures and shutdown.</li>
                <li>Application Logs: third-party applications.
                  To view these in Windows we can use the EventViewer, but we can use SYSLOG to do it more efficient,
                  this uses port 514 over UDP.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="246-log-files">24.6 Log Files</h3>
              <p>They allow us to reconstruct an event after it occurred. We need to configure these files properly, do
                we want to log everything, how often do we want to take them out and else; they should be save on an
                external server or device so if the server is damaged we can take them from somewhere else. We need to
                think in every possible event in the case that the logs are very big or that we run out of space or if
                we get to the maximum capacity; these files should be archived and backed up using Write Once Read Many
                (WORM), if someone hacks they can not delete them, and how can we even protect these files internally
                like encrypt them keeping them out of people eyes.</p>

                Management Systems (SIEM)</h3>
              <p>Logs should not be review inly after an incident, they should be review constantly. We need to
                establish and document the scope of event, as well as develop use cases to define a threat, and plan
                incident response plans before an event, we need to establish a ticketing process to track events, also
                schedule threat hunting and finally provide auditors and analyst an evidence trail. There are many SIEM
                solutions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Splunk, can be installed locally or cloud-based solution.</li>
                <li>ELK/Elastic Stack, it is a collection of free and open source tools for SIEMs.</li>
                <li>ArcSight.</li>
                <li>QRadar.</li>
                <li>Alien Vault and Open-Source Security Information Management (OSSIM), this can integrate other
                  administrative tools to manage the whole security environment.</li>
                <li>Graylog, it is really focus on DevOps.</li>

              <p>A protocol to enable different apps to send logs, works with a client-server model. It usually runs on
                port 514 using UDP over TCP/IP. Using this protocol may generate issues so we need to solve this. Some
                solutions are call syslog-nexgen; syslog can refer to the protocol, the server or the log entries
                themselves.</p>

              <p>It is a security tool that facilitates the incident response process, it takes a security information
                and monitoring systems and it is integrated with this SOAR. We can program playbooks, scan security and
                threat data, analyze the data with ML and automate data enrichment, and do incident response. A playbook
                is a checklist of actions to perform, detect and respond to a specific type of incident. A run-book is a
                lot of automations combined.</p>
              <h2 id="25-cryptography">25 Cryptography</h2>
              <p>It is the practice of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of something, usually refer as
                encryption, we use it for data at rest, in transit and in use. The important part is the key. A cipher
                is an algorithm that performs the decryption or encryption; these are mathematical functions. If we are
                able to make the algorithm public then we have a good algorithm because the key is the secure part.</p>
              <h3 id="251-symmetric-vs-asymmetric">25.1 Symmetric vs Asymmetric</h3>
              <p>These are categorized for the cipher, symmetric we have only one key to both encrypt and decrypt (these
                are usually call private key); asymmetric is when we have one key for encryption and one for decryption
                (this is call public key); with private key we can not have non-repudiation policy, also the key
                distribution is a problem. Using asymmetric algorithms we have a public key, non of them are better
                since they are for different purposes. Most things uses hybrid implementations; public key is slower so
                usually people sends the symmetric key transfer over asymmetric. Block Cipher os break the message into
                fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryptions, encrypts by blocks. Stream cipher are the
                contrary and are usually used in hardware.</p>
              <h3 id="252-symmetric-algorithms">25.2 Symmetric Algorithms</h3>
              <p>Some of the algorithms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>DES: breaks the input into 64-bit key, now it is not usually used since can be easily breakable.
                </li>
                <li>3DES: there were 3 64-bit keys used, it jumped into the function three types, however it was slow.
                </li>
                <li>IDEA: uses a 64-bit key.</li>
                <li>AES: replacement for DES, using 128, 192 or 256 bit key. It is the standard encryption for US.</li>
                <li>Blowfish &amp; Twofish: supposed to be the AES but was not taken.</li>
                <li>RC4, RC5, RC6: can be used 40-2048 bits encryption; this is used in the SSL. Only RC4 is stream
                  cipher, all the other are block cipher.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="253-public-key-cryptography">25.3 Public Key Cryptography</h3>
              <p>This covers the confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. We encrypt something
                using the public key and decrypting it using the private key; and from the other part anyone can see by
                my public key that I was the one that sent a message but this is how it should be. A digital signature
                is a hash used to let the recipient know who sent the message. Asymmetric encryption is know as public
                key and uses to two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.</p>
              <h3 id="254-asymmetric-algorithms">25.4 Asymmetric Algorithms</h3>
              <p>They are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Diffie-Hellman (DH): it is used for key distribution, this means sending a private key, however it
                  is vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. It is usually used for VPN configurations.</li>
                <li>RSA: digital signatures, uses private key pairs between 1024-4096 bits algorithms. </li>
                <li>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): it is very efficient, it is very used in mobile devices since
                  they do not have a lot of computer power. There are some variants combining this with DH for example.
                </li>

              <p>This is the program (PGP) used to encrypt emails but not is used to encrypt files, it uses IDEA but as
                a hybrid cipher implementation. Uses 128 symmetric functions or 512-2046 for asymmetric functions.</p>
              <h3 id="256-key-management">25.6 Key Management</h3>
              <p>Refers to how an organization generates, exchanges and stores the encryption keys; the encryption
                relies in the key strength, not in the algorithm. Keys must be securely stored and periodically change.

              <h3 id="257-one-time-pad">25.7 One-Time Pad</h3>
              <p>It is a stream cipher that encrypts with the same length as the plaintext input. Once that the code is
                used it is destroyed, not mathematic function was used. There is one problem that is that no computer
                can create truly random numbers so another computer may reverse engineer this.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Public Ledger: a system that keeps participants identities secure and anonymous, it is decentralized
                  so no one can change it without authorization.</li>
                <li>Quantum Computing: we used superposition bits, this is a very big problem for encryption.</li>
                <li>Post-quantum Cryptography: it is something done with today&#39;s computer but that can not be break
                  with quantum computing.</li>
                <li>Ephemeral: a cryptographic keys used to be short-lived and used to exchange key, for example it is
                  used in WPA3.</li>
                <li>Homomorphic Encryption: allows calculations to be performed on data without decrypting it, can be
                  used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation, this is perfect for example for cloud
                  computing so the vendors can perform the operations they need without watching our data if this type
                  of encryption is supported.</li>

              <p>It is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and makes a unique message, makes it a
                digital print, and the output is always the same length, the most common one is MD5, when two files has
                the same hash it is call a collision, SHA is the replacement for MD5. SHA-3 is the newest, has the 224
                and 512 bits. Hashes are used to assure integrity (like digital signatures); the most commons are MD5
                and SHA-Families.</p>

              <p>They are open-source hashing algorithms. To prevent a collision to happen we can use a digital
                signature, which is a to create the hash and then encrypt it for sending, this will also makes a
                non-repudiation solution, this makes that we can assure the other was the one sending the message. DSA
                and RSA are some algorithms for digital signatures.</p>

                <li>Pass the Hash: hacking technique to authenticate using the hash stored, they do not need to
                  brute-force the password, they only need the password; it is very difficult to defend from it. many
                  tools can do this, like Mimikatz; to prevent this we need to make sure updates are done and least
                  privilege.</li>
                <li>Birthday Attack: when attackers makes an intentionally collision, to attack a system matching the

                is traveling because it is decrypted using the private key. PKI is a system that creates pairs of keys
                to make a sure and safe connection, but we also need the Digital Certificate.</p>

              <p>It is a digitally signed document that binds a public key to an user. The X.509 is the certificate that
                can be used for multiple domains, a wildcard can be used but if this one is vulnerable then all the
                domains will lose the certificate. The SAN (Subject Alternative Name) is what allows a user to assign
                domain and IP Address to this domain. Some certificates do dual-sided certificates which is make the
                server and user to validate the certificate but this makes double the work.</p>

                sent and received. The problem is that encrypts all contents, even malware, which makes the filters and
                other things vulnerable; so some emails providers will load the private key to decode previous to

                mostly used with HTTP. Or we can also used it with emails to ensure encryption. TLS can be attack by a
                downgrade attack, which is tricking the protocol to use an older version of TLS that is vulnerable so
                can be exploit, web servers can be configured to never downgrade. Break and Inspect is acting in the

                <li>L2TP: Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol: it is not secure because it is usually paired with IPSec to work
                  together since this one runs in private networks. IPSec: authenticates and encrypts IP packets, it
                  provides confidentiality, integrity and authentication and can be set in Main, Aggressive or Quick
                  mode. A Security Association (SA) it is an establishment of secure connections that shares
                  certificates. IPSec can work in Transport Mode (does not include the header encryption) people know
                  where came from but not what; in the Tunnel Mode both header and content are encrypted, it is used to

                <li>RAID 0: provides data striping for multiple disk.</li>
                <li>RAID 1: uses two identical disk.</li>
                <li>RAID 5: requires at least 3 disks to work, it has very good redundancy.</li>
                <li>RAID 6: modified form of a RAID 5, it has two stripes for parity data, we need at least 4 disk.</li>
                <li>RAID 10: combines the RAID 1 and 0; gives a redundant mirror and it is fully redundant.</li>
                <li>Disaster-Tolerant RAID.</li>

              <p>To achieve this we need to do clustering, which is making two servers work together to make a

                will only have the basic phones and services and nothing is configure it will take a few days to have
                ready; this will depend on the company needs.</p>

                contact information, calculate the impact determination and the recovery plan which is knowing what to
                do; and have copies of agreements, and do disaster recovery exercises for the employees to know what to
                do, at least once a year; and we need to have a list of critical systems and data to know what recover

                instructions created by a given action, for example on how to create a new user account. Most of these
                things are already created but we can create our own. The most important is that policies are generic
                guidance, procedures are specific.</p>
              <h3 id="311-data-classifications">31.1 Data Classifications</h3>
              <p>Sensitive data is any information that can create a loss of security of advantage to a company, but
                they have classifications, and a problem is over classifying data; if the company is commercial then
                classifications are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Public Data: will have no impact to the company if released.</li>
                <li>Sensitive Data: minimal impact on the company.</li>
                <li>Private Data: personal records, salary informations.</li>
                <li>Confidential Data: highest classifications and even source code.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now if we are a government the classifications are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unclassified: can be released to the public.</li>
                <li>Sensitive but unclassified: impact a few people but not a national security threat.</li>
                <li>Confidential: seriously affects the government if released.</li>
                <li>Secret: can damaged the government.</li>
                <li>Top Secret: gravely damage the government.
                  The data should not be store forever because this will increase a lot of costs.</li>

                <li>Privacy Officer: responsible of the oversight of any asset managed by the company.
                  The data owner should be someone from the business, the IT the custodian.
                  Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and PHI
                  If a piece of data can be used alone or in combination to identify someone then this is consider PII;
                  also the PHI is consider the Personal Health Information. The Privacy Act of 1974 concerns anything
                  related to personal data, the other is HIPAA, which is related to medical data, SOX is related to
                  public-traded US companies, if this one is failed to follow the CEO can go to jail, the GLBA affects
                  financial institutions, other one is FISMA, PCI DSS for credit cards, HAVA for security of the systems
                  of election cycles, and the SB 1386 for data breaches in CA.</li>

                contact list. We need to determined at what point we need to call the on-call person; we need to
                determined who to notified people, this depends on the organization procedures; how to contact them is
                also important and depends on the priority; and how far out we want this information to go.</p>
              <p>The CSIRT will have to determine downtime, scope of the affected systems and else; we also need to see
                who are the affected stakeholders:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Senior Leaders: executives and managers who respond for business operations, they have another coin
                  face when we want to do something.</li>
                <li>Regulatory Bodies: for example the GDPR if something happened in European servers.</li>
                <li>Legal: they have to mitigate risk for civil lawsuits.</li>
                <li>Law Enforcements: this decision must be made with guidance from the Legal department.</li>
                <li>Human Resources (HR): used to ensure that are no breaches of employment law or contracts.</li>
                <li>Public Relations (PR): manage negative publicity.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="322-investigation-data">32.2 Investigation Data</h3>
              <p>Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM), this help us given important dashboards, we need to
                think of the: sensors, sensitivity (how frequent we&#39;ll received info), trends, alerts and
                correlation. We also need to consider the logs, can be: network, system, application, security, web,
                dns, authentication, dump files (something that was dropped), VoIP and call managers; each of them
                should be correlated.
                Syslog/rsyslog/syslog-ng all these are the same, they take the logs and send them to a central point
                where we&#39;ll have them; journalctl, nxlog are platforms that help us analyze logs, this last one is
                cross-platform. netflow is used in networking created by Cisco and collect IP traffic; we also have
                sflow, it is an open-source or netflow.</p>
              <p>Internet Protocol Information Export (IPfix) is used to facilitate how IP information should be
                formatted and transferred from an exported to a collector; basically a standard so the metrics are
                correct in every case. Metadata is very important too.</p>
              <h3 id="323-forensic-procedures">32.3 Forensic Procedures</h3>
              <p>Everything done is made done with compliance with the procedures, doing it always the same way:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Identification: ensure the scene is safe and prevent evidence contamination, making sure is safe.
                </li>
                <li>Collection: we need to have authorization to collect the evidence and prove the integrity of the
                  evidence as is collected, for example making an exact copy of the disk.</li>
                <li>Analysis: we make a copy of the evidence for analysis, everything is made by a procedure and made
                  repeatable procedures.</li>
                <li>Reporting: create a report of the methods of what I found, how I found it, all locations, files,
                  etc; everything we did is going to be tested for someone trying to make it invalid.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Legal Hold is a process designed to preserve all relevant information for a possible trial; we need to
                think in even having backup of the data in case the computer/server is taken away. We must have ethics:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Analysis must be perform without bias, we do not judge on race, religion or else.</li>
                <li>Analysis methods must be repeatable by third parties.</li>
                <li>Evidence must not be changed or manipulated, we should never do analysis on the hard drive, instead
                  to make a copy for analysis for modifying the things.
                  Defense attorneys will try to use any deviation from these ethics as a reason to dismiss our findings
                  and analysis. A timeline will show the sequence of file system events in a graphical form; it is very
                  important to have some type of timeline, if it is not available automatically we may have to do it
                  manually but should be included.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="324-data-collection-procedures">32.4 Data Collection Procedures</h3>
              <p>We use techniques to recover the system as quick as possible but also maintaining the evidence.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Capture and hash the system images.</li>
                <li>Analyze data with tools.</li>
                <li>Capture screenshot, even of the machine.</li>
                <li>Review network traffic and logs.</li>

                <li>Consider order of volatility.</li>
                <li>Take statements of witness and administrators.</li>
                <li>Review licensing and documentation.</li>
                <li>Track man-hours and expenses.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Data Acquisition is the method and tools used to create a forensically copy of data from a device, we
                need to know if we have the authorization to collect data, this could be an issue if the device is owned
                by the employee, we even need to consider that some data can be lost if the device is shutdown, this is
                the order:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>CPU registers and cache memory.</li>
                <li>RAM, routing tables, ARP Cache, temporary files.</li>
                <li>HDD/SDD/Flash Drive.</li>
                <li>Remote logging and monitored data.</li>
                <li>Physical configuration and network topology.</li>
                <li>Archival media.
                  Important to know that the Windows registry is stored in some special part of the memory and so we
                  should analyze the registry via a memory dump.</li>
